To create the sound file for the app:

1. Download a free sound effect from a website like:
   - https://freesound.org/
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
   - https://soundbible.com/

2. Look for a short "notification" or "alert" sound that's about 1-2 seconds long

3. Save the sound file as "sigma_boy.mp3" in this folder

4. Make sure the file is:
   - Named exactly "sigma_boy.mp3"
   - In MP3 format
   - Less than 1MB in size
   - Placed directly in this folder

The sound will play when the timer reaches the bridge buff times.
